=head1 NAME

Promised::Command::Signals - Promise-aware signal handling

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Promised::Command::Signals;
  my $sig = Promised::Command::Signals->add_handler (TERM => sub {
    return write_log ('SIGTERM received')->then (sub {
      return $server->stop;
    });
  });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Promised::Command::Signals> module defines a signal handler
registry where handler codes are invoked when a signal is received.
If the handler codes return promises, the default action of the signal
(i.e. terminating the script) is invoked after the resolution or
rejection of them.

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are available:

=over 4

=item $sig = Promised::Command::Signals->add_handler ($name, $code)

Register a signal handler code.

The first argument must be a name of the signal, such as C<INT> or
C<HUP>.  At the time of writing, signals C<INT>, C<TERM>, C<QUIT>, and
C<HUP> are supported.

The second argument must be a code reference.  When invoked, it can
return a promise.  Any exception invoked by the code is treated as if
there were a rejected promise with that exception.  The handler is
invoked with a code reference, which, when invoked, cancels the
default action of the signal.  For example, a C<INT> signal is
canceled, the script is not terminated after the processing of signal
handlers.  Note that canceling the default action does not prevent
from other signal handler codes invoked.

It returns an object.  The application must preserve a reference to it
while the handler code should be effective.

=item undef $sig

When all references to the object returned by the C<add_handler>
method is discarded, the code is removed from the registry so that it
is no longer invoked by the signal.
